      <p>Migration is not simply the act of moving from one geographical location to another. It's a profound transformation that reshapes your identity, challenges your understanding of home, and forces you to reconcile who you were with who you're becoming.</p>

      <p>When I first left Kazakhstan to study abroad, I thought migration meant adventure, new opportunities, and freedom. I imagined myself as a cosmopolitan citizen of the world, unbound by borders and traditions. What I didn't anticipate was the quiet ache of displacement, the subtle ways in which leaving home would fundamentally alter my sense of self.</p>

      <h2>The Weight of Distance</h2>

      <p>There's a particular loneliness that comes with migration that no one prepares you for. It's not the dramatic, tear-stained loneliness of farewell scenes at airports. It's quieter, more persistent. It emerges in small moments: when you can't find the right words to explain a childhood memory, when holidays pass without the familiar rhythms of home, when you realize you're experiencing milestones your family will only hear about through phone screens.</p>

      <blockquote>"Home is not a place, but a feeling of belonging that you carry within you—even when you're thousands of miles away from the land that raised you."</blockquote>

      <p>Distance changes relationships in unexpected ways. Conversations with family become carefully scheduled events, timezone calculations become second nature, and you learn to compress months of experiences into brief video calls. You develop a parallel life that exists primarily in stories you'll tell when—if—you return.</p>

      <h2>Between Two Worlds</h2>

      <p>One of the most disorienting aspects of migration is the feeling of existing between worlds. You're no longer fully at home in your country of origin, but you'll never be completely native to your adopted land either. You become a cultural translator, constantly switching codes, explaining contexts, bridging gaps that others don't even notice exist.</p>

      <p>Your identity becomes hyphenated, complex, difficult to summarize in simple terms. You're Kazakh, but also international. You're from there, but also from here. You belong everywhere and nowhere simultaneously. This liminal space can feel isolating, but it's also where some of the most interesting personal growth happens.</p>

      <h3>The Evolution of Home</h3>

      <p>Over time, I've come to understand that migration isn't about choosing between homes—it's about expanding your definition of home. Home becomes less about a fixed location and more about a constellation of people, memories, languages, and experiences that you carry with you.</p>

      <blockquote>"Perhaps not belonging anywhere means you have the freedom to belong everywhere, to create home wherever you are rather than waiting to find it."</blockquote>

      <h2>Redefining Success</h2>

      <p>For many Kazakh students and professionals abroad, there's immense pressure to justify migration through conventional success metrics: prestigious degrees, high-paying jobs, impressive LinkedIn profiles. But I've learned that migration's true value often lies in subtler transformations.</p>

      <p>Success might mean learning to be comfortable with discomfort. It might mean developing resilience you didn't know you needed. It might mean discovering aspects of yourself that would have remained dormant if you'd never left home.</p>

      <p>Migration is messy, complicated, and often difficult. But it's also enriching, transformative, and deeply human. To every Kazakh student or professional reading this from abroad: your experience is valid, your struggles are real, and your hybrid identity is not a weakness but a strength.</p>

      <p>Every year, thousands of Kazakh students apply to universities abroad, dreaming of world-class education, global networks, and transformative experiences. We're told that studying abroad is an investment in our future, a ticket to better opportunities, a chance to "find ourselves" in foreign lands. But is it really worth it?</p>

      <p>I'm writing this from my apartment in London, three years into a degree that has cost more than my parents' combined salaries for a decade. I've gained things I never could have imagined—and lost things I didn't know I valued. This isn't a story with a simple yes or no answer. It's more complicated than that.</p>

      <h2>The Dream vs. The Reality</h2>

      <p>The promotional materials for international universities sell a specific vision: diverse classrooms, intellectual debates with brilliant peers, professors who are leaders in their fields, career opportunities that will change your life trajectory. And to be fair, some of this is true.</p>

      <p>What they don't show you is the 3 AM anxiety attacks when you're wondering if this degree will actually be worth the debt. The isolation of being the only person in your cohort who has to explain where Kazakhstan is on a map. The exhaustion of code-switching between languages, cultures, and identities multiple times a day.</p>

      <blockquote>"Education abroad promises transformation, and it delivers—but not always the kind of transformation you expected or wanted."</blockquote>

      <h2>The Financial Reality Check</h2>

      <p>Let's talk about money, because nobody wants to. International tuition fees are astronomical. Even with scholarships, the cost of living in major cities can drain your savings faster than you ever anticipated. You calculate exchange rates in your head constantly. You skip social events because you can't afford another restaurant meal.</p>

      <p>The financial burden isn't just about numbers in a bank account. It's psychological weight. It's the pressure to make every moment "count," to justify the investment, to succeed spectacularly enough that the sacrifice feels worth it.</p>

      <h2>What You Actually Learn</h2>

      <p>Here's the thing though: I have learned an incredible amount. Not all of it came from classrooms, and much of it wasn't in the course catalog.</p>

      <p>I learned resilience. How to navigate bureaucratic systems in a second language. How to build community from scratch in a place where you know no one. How to advocate for yourself when professors mispronounce your name or make assumptions about your background.</p>

      <blockquote>"The most valuable education abroad isn't what you learn in lectures—it's what you learn about yourself when everything familiar is stripped away."</blockquote>

      <h2>So... Is It Worth It?</h2>

      <p>For me, personally, yes. But that answer comes with qualifications, caveats, and acknowledgment of privilege. I had family support, scholarships, and circumstances that made this path possible. Not everyone does.</p>

      <p>Studying abroad has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my life. It's made me more independent, more aware, more capable. But it's also been lonely, expensive, and sometimes unbearably hard.</p>

      <p>The real question isn't whether studying abroad is worth it in general—it's whether it's worth it for you, given your specific goals, resources, and circumstances.</p>

      <p>There's a particular kind of loneliness that comes from being too foreign everywhere you go. In Kazakhstan, people ask why my Russian has an accent. In Europe, I'm perpetually explaining where my country is on a map. I exist in the hyphen between cultures, in the pause between languages, in the uncertain space where "home" becomes a question rather than an answer.</p>

      <p>I used to think this feeling was temporary—that eventually, I would settle into one identity, one place, one clear sense of belonging. I'm beginning to realize that for people like me, belonging isn't a destination. It's something else entirely.</p>

      <h2>The Geography of Identity</h2>

      <p>I was born in Almaty but left when I was eight. I grew up between three countries, attending international schools where everyone was from somewhere else. My friends were Korean-Americans born in Singapore, Turkish kids who'd lived in six countries, British children who'd never actually lived in Britain.</p>

      <p>We were third culture kids—formed not by one national culture but by the experience of moving between them. Our shared culture was transition itself, adaptation itself, the particular skills required to be perpetually new.</p>

      <blockquote>"Home wasn't a place on a map. It was the feeling of being understood without having to explain yourself first."</blockquote>

      <h2>Neither Here Nor There</h2>

      <p>When I visit Kazakhstan, I'm treated as slightly foreign. My cousins make gentle fun of my accent. I miss cultural references everyone else my age grew up with. I have to Google Kazakh political figures. I don't instinctively understand certain social codes.</p>

      <p>But abroad, I'll always be the Kazakh girl. No matter how many years I live elsewhere, no matter how fluent I become in other languages, my face marks me as Other. People make assumptions about my background, my education, my experiences—assumptions that are sometimes flattering, often inaccurate, always reductive.</p>

      <h2>Making Peace with In-Between</h2>

      <p>I'm slowly learning to stop seeing my in-between-ness as a problem to be solved. For years, I thought I needed to choose—to commit fully to being Kazakh or to assimilate completely into wherever I was living. To pick a side, plant roots, stay still long enough to finally belong.</p>

      <p>But that's not who I am. I'm not meant to fit neatly into one national category. My identity is genuinely hybrid, formed by movement and multiplicity. That's not a failure of belonging—it's a different kind of belonging.</p>

      <blockquote>"You don't have to choose between worlds. You can build bridges between them and walk back and forth freely."</blockquote>

      <h2>To Others Living Between</h2>

      <p>If you're reading this and recognizing yourself in these words, I want you to know: your complicated identity is valid. You don't have to choose. You don't have to simplify yourself to make others comfortable. You don't have to fit neatly into checkboxes that weren't designed for people like us.</p>

      <p>The discomfort of not quite belonging anywhere is real, and it's okay to grieve for the simple rootedness you might never have. But there's also beauty in your multiplicity, strength in your ability to navigate between worlds, wisdom in your expanded perspective.</p>

      <p>You are not lost. You are not broken. You are not failing at identity. You're just complex in ways that simple categories can't capture. And maybe that's exactly as it should be.</p>

    title: 'From Almaty to New York: Finding Home Abroad',
    subtitle: 'Moving to the US was both terrifying and exciting. The hardest part wasn't the language—it was missing the smell of baursak in the morning and learning to build a new kind of home.',

      <p>The first morning I woke up in New York City, I reached instinctively for my phone to call my mom. Then I remembered: it was 2 AM in Almaty. This simple arithmetic—adding or subtracting hours, calculating when it was appropriate to miss someone—became the rhythm of my new life.</p>

      <p>I arrived in August 2022 with two suitcases, a scholarship letter, and the kind of naive confidence that comes from never having truly been alone. I was 18 years old and convinced that adapting to New York would be my greatest adventure. I wasn't wrong, but I also had no idea what "adapting" would actually require.</p>

      <h2>The Language Paradox</h2>

      <p>Everyone warned me about the language barrier. I'd studied English since childhood, aced my TOEFL, and felt prepared for academic discussions. What I wasn't prepared for was the loneliness of understanding every word while missing every subtext.</p>

      <blockquote>"Fluency isn't just vocabulary. It's knowing which silence is comfortable and which is awkward, which joke will land and which will require too much explanation."</blockquote>

      <h2>The Small Things You Don't Expect to Miss</h2>

      <p>Before I left, people asked what I'd miss most about Kazakhstan. I gave predictable answers: my family, my friends, the mountains. All true, but incomplete.</p>

      <p>What actually broke my heart in unexpected moments: the smell of baursak frying on Saturday mornings. The specific way my grandmother said my name. Hearing Kazakh or Russian spoken casually on the street. Markets where vendors spoke to you like family.</p>

      <p>I missed beshbarmak so intensely that I tried making it in my dorm's shared kitchen. It tasted wrong with American ingredients, and I cried over a pot of incorrectly spiced meat like it was a profound personal failure.</p>

      <h2>Building Community from Scratch</h2>

      <p>New York has eight million people, but I'd never felt so alone. In Almaty, I had friends I'd known since childhood, family dinners every weekend, a built-in social structure. Here, I had to construct community from nothing.</p>

      <p>I found other international students first—not because we had much in common beyond displacement, but because they understood the particular exhaustion of always performing cultural translation.</p>

      <blockquote>"Homesickness doesn't go away. You just get better at carrying it."</blockquote>

      <h2>Redefining Home</h2>

      <p>Three years in, I still don't have a simple answer to "where is home?" Almaty is home—it's where my family lives, where my childhood memories are rooted, where I feel most fundamentally myself. But New York is also becoming home—it's where I've grown up, built community, created a life.</p>

      <p>I've stopped trying to choose. I'm learning to hold both truths simultaneously: I can miss Almaty desperately while also loving my life in New York. I can be homesick for Kazakhstan while being grateful for opportunities I have here. I can be Kazakh and global, rooted and displaced, belonging to multiple places at once.</p>

      <p>Home is portable, multiple, flexible. It's something I create rather than something I find. And maybe that's exactly what I needed to learn.</p>

      <p>Aruzhan Maulen is a 22-year-old International Relations student at Korea University in Seoul. Originally from Shymkent, she moved to South Korea three years ago to pursue her undergraduate degree. We sat down with her (virtually, across time zones) to discuss her experience as a Kazakh student in one of Asia's most dynamic cities.</p>

      <p class="interview-q">Let's start at the beginning. Why South Korea? It's not the most obvious choice for Kazakh students.</p>

      <p>That's exactly why I chose it! Everyone I knew was going to the US, UK, or Russia. I wanted something different. South Korea offered this fascinating blend of deep tradition and cutting-edge modernity. Plus, the Korean government offers generous scholarships for international students, which made it financially possible.</p>

      <p class="interview-q">What surprised you most when you first arrived in Seoul?</p>

      <p>How hierarchical everything is! Korean culture has this intricate system of age-based respect that's baked into the language itself. There are different verb endings depending on whether you're speaking to someone older, younger, or the same age as you. Coming from Kazakhstan, where we also have respect for elders but less linguistic formality, it took serious adjustment.</p>

      <blockquote>"Seoul taught me that adaptation isn't about erasing your own culture—it's about making space for both cultures to coexist within you."</blockquote>

      <p class="interview-q">Did you find any unexpected similarities between Kazakh and Korean cultures?</p>

      <p>So many! Both cultures have this deep respect for education and family. The collectivist mindset where group harmony matters more than individual expression. The food culture—we both love fermented foods, grilled meat, and eating communally.</p>

      <p>There are even linguistic connections. Some Korean words have Altaic roots similar to Turkic languages. When I learned that Seoul was called "Seorabol" historically, potentially connected to the Turkic word "saray" meaning palace, I felt this unexpected historical connection.</p>

      <p class="interview-q">What's the Kazakh student community like in Seoul?</p>

      <p>Small but tight-knit! There are maybe 200-300 Kazakh students across all of Seoul's universities. We find each other through Facebook groups and university Kazakh student associations. Every few months, someone organizes a gathering where we make plov together, celebrate Nauryz, or just speak Russian and Kazakh without having to translate our thoughts.</p>

      <p class="interview-q">What advice would you give Kazakh students considering studying in Korea?</p>

      <p>First, learn Korean before you arrive. Even basic proficiency makes a huge difference in your adjustment and social integration. Don't rely only on English—many Koreans are shy about their English skills and will open up more if you speak Korean.</p>

      <p>Second, be ready for intense academic culture. Korean universities are rigorous. Come prepared to work hard and manage stress healthily.</p>

      <p>Finally, stay connected to Kazakhstan. Your Kazakh identity is an asset, not something to hide or minimize. Korean people are fascinated by different cultures when you present yours with pride and knowledge.</p>

      <blockquote>"You don't have to choose between worlds. You can build bridges between them and walk back and forth freely."</blockquote>

      <p class="interview-q">What has Seoul taught you about yourself?</p>

      <p>That I'm more resilient than I thought. Moving to a country where I didn't speak the language fluently, didn't know anyone, had to navigate completely different cultural norms—that takes courage I didn't know I had.</p>

      <p>Seoul taught me that growth happens outside comfort zones. Every challenge—language barriers, cultural misunderstandings, academic pressure—has made me stronger, more adaptable, more empathetic.</p>

      <p>It also taught me about identity's complexity. I'm Kazakh, always will be. But I'm also someone shaped by living in Seoul, speaking Korean, navigating between cultures. These aren't contradictory identities—they're layers that make me more dimensional.</p>
